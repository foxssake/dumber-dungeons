# Dumber Dungeons

Dumb Adventures in Dumber Dungeons, right in your browser!

Dumber Dungeons is a multiplayer, turn-based RPG where you crawl dungeons with
your buddies, to be played in front of a TV in someone's living room.

In addition to being a game, it is also an open project - issues, discussions
and development docs are also uploaded here, for everyone to take a look at our
approach to building this game.

## Docs

Docs are served using [mkdocs] and the [mkdocs_puml] addon. From the repo root,
install and serve the site:

```sh
pip install mkdocs mkdocs_puml
mkdocs serve
```

The site will be accessible at <http://127.0.0.1:8006/>.
