# Dumber Dungeons

Dumb Adventures in Dumber Dungeons, right in your browser!

## Overview

Dumber Dungeons is a turn-based, online multiplayer RPG, focused around couch
coop and group play - imagine JackBox but as an RPG. Players gather in a shared
game session by entering the same code or opening the same URL, setup their
characters, and then embark on a turn-based adventure.

The adventure consists of the classical RPG tropes, including casting spells,
executing calculated moves, looting items, discovering dungeons, and upgrading
their characters.

The game's tone is centered around wizard-related shitposting, akin to
[r/wizardposting].

The game can eventually be structured as a role-playing engine, i.e. content (
spells, maps, etc. ) can be plugged in or swapped in the form of mods.

### Why play

The game experience would focus on the following core pillars:

* Cooperative gameplay
* Non-serious tone
* Replayability

Dumber Dungeons can be played remotely, or from a TV / PC / laptop / tablet
around which people gather to play.

### Why develop

Dumber Dungeon will be an open source reference piece that solves a few
interesting problems and integrations, e.g.:

* Performant rendering - [three.js] / [pixi.js]
* Realtime communication - WebSockets
* Managing current and multiple hypothetical game states to visualize drafted
  actions
* Moddable architecture to decouple core game engine and content
